Varnish Test Cases Examples

DESCRIPTION
===========

That's a collection of Varnish test cases. 
Some of them are documented, if documentation is missing I'm happy to accept PR.

Please note that the VCL state in the test cases is not supposed to be production ready.
You can copy/paste and extend it, but deployment of it in prodution is at your own risk.
